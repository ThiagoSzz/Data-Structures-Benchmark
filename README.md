# **Data Structures Benchmark**
### C.17, 29/11/2020

### A benchmark program made in C to evaluate the most apropriate data structure for inserting and consulting numeric values in a Linked List, a Binary Tree and an AVL Tree
### The computed metrics are shortest execution time and less comparisons made overall
### Four different number set sizes were considered: 5.000, 10.000, 100.000 and 1.000.000 values
### The execution of the program should print all sets results as well as the best result for each structure, metric and set in the command prompt
